## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (package manager)
- Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ubuzima-connect.git
cd ubuzima-connect
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure Firebase**

Open `firebaseconfig.ts` and ensure your Firebase project credentials are set:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your_api_key",
  authDomain: "your_project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your_project_id",
  storageBucket: "your_project.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "your_sender_id",
  appId: "your_app_id"
};
```

4. **Enable Firebase services**

In the Firebase Console:
- Go to Authentication > Sign-in method > Enable Email/Password and Google
- Go to Firestore Database > Create database in production mode

5. **Run the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Open the application**

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## System Design (UML Diagrams)

### Use Case Diagram
![Use Case Diagram 1](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/use_case1_diagram.png)

![Use Case Diagram 2](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/use_case2_diagram.png)

The use case diagram shows two actors: **Radiologist** (primary user) and **Admin** (future). The radiologist can register, login, upload X-rays, view AI results, search patient history, view model performance, and manage their profile. The admin (to be built later) will handle model retraining and user management.

### Class Diagram
![Class Diagram](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/class_diagram.png)

The class diagram defines three core entities: **User** (authentication and profile data stored in Firestore), **DiagnosisRecord** (patient diagnosis data including result, confidence, observation, and review status), and **MLModel** (model metadata and evaluation metrics). Relationships show that one User performs many DiagnosisRecords, and one MLModel generates many AnalysisResults.

### Sequence Diagram -- Login Flow
![Login Sequence](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/Sequence_login_flow.png)

This sequence diagram traces the login process: the user enters credentials on the Auth page, Firebase Auth validates them, the user profile is fetched from Firestore, and the dashboard loads with the user's data. Error handling shows how invalid credentials are communicated back to the user.

### Sequence Diagram -- Diagnosis Flow
![Diagnosis Sequence](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/Sequence_diagnosis_flow.png)

This sequence diagram shows the diagnostic workflow: the radiologist uploads a chest X-ray, the image is sent to the ML model API for inference, the prediction (Normal/TB/Pneumonia) with confidence score is returned and displayed, and the diagnosis record is saved to the patient history.

### Activity Diagram
![Activity Diagram](screenshoots/uml%20diagrams/activity_diagram.png)

The activity diagram maps the complete user journey from app load through the intro animation, hero page, authentication (login or register), and into the dashboard where the user can navigate between diagnostic, history, performance, and settings tabs before signing out.
